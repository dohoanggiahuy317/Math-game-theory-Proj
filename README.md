2. **100 Oranges Game**

## Instructions

### Apple Picking Game

Players take turns picking 1 or 2 consecutive apples. The player who picks the last apple wins the game. 

- **Player vs Player Mode**: Two players alternate turns picking apples.
- **Player vs Computer Mode**: The player competes against the computer.

**Special Rule**: The apple is not picked, it is eaten. Hence, it will not go away from the list but turn into gray color. If the player chooses 2 apples and tries to select an apple that has no adjacent apple, it is invalid, and they cannot select it.

### 100 Oranges Game

Two players eat 100 oranges by turn. Each turn, each player can choose any number of oranges between 1 to 100 and eat it. Whoever eats the last orange wins the game.

- **Player vs Player Mode**: Two players alternate turns eating oranges.
- **Player vs Computer Mode**: The player competes against the computer.

### Cool Tic Tac Toe

This game is a twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The number of maximum signs for each player on the board at any time is 3 signs. At each player's turn, before they make a new move, if the new signs will be more than 3, the oldest sign gets blurred, and when they make the move, the oldest sign disappears and no longer counts to determine the winning.

- **Player vs Player Mode**: Two players alternate turns placing their signs.
- **Player vs Computer Mode**: The player competes against the computer.

**Special Rule**: The computer uses smarter tactics to block the player's potential winning moves while also trying to create its own winning opportunities.
